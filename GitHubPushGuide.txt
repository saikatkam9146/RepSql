Follow these steps to upload your ReportingSchedulerWeb project to GitHub. This guide is beginner-friendly and safe to keep in your project folder.

## 1. Create a GitHub Account
- Go to https://github.com
- Sign up or log in
- **Explanation:** You need a GitHub account to create repositories and store your code online.

## 2. Create a New Repository
- Click the "+" icon (top right) â†’ "New repository"
- Name your repo (e.g., `ReportingSchedulerWeb`)
- Choose public or private
- Click "Create repository"
- **Explanation:** This creates a space on GitHub to store your project. The repo name should match your project or be descriptive.

## 3. Initialize Git Locally
- Open your terminal in `D:\Angular\ReportingSchedulerWeb`
- Run these commands:
  ```
  git init
  git add .
  git commit -m "Initial commit"
  ```
- **Explanation:**
  - `git init` starts a new local git repository in your project folder.
  - `git add .` stages all files for commit.
  - `git commit -m "Initial commit"` saves your project snapshot with a message.

## 4. Connect Local Repo to GitHub
- Copy your repo URL from GitHub (e.g., `https://github.com/your-username/ReportingSchedulerWeb.git`)
- Run these commands:
  ```
  git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/ReportingSchedulerWeb.git
  git branch -M main
  git push -u origin main
  ```
- **Explanation:**
  - The repo URL is found on your GitHub repo page (click the green "Code" button and copy the HTTPS link).
  - `git remote add origin ...` links your local repo to the GitHub repo.
  - `git branch -M main` sets your branch name to `main` (standard for new repos).
  - `git push -u origin main` uploads your code to GitHub.

## 5. Done!
- Your project is now on GitHub.
- You can share the repo or invite collaborators.
- **Explanation:** Your code is now safely stored online and can be accessed from anywhere.

## Optional: Add a .gitignore File
- Create a file named `.gitignore` in your project folder.
- Add these lines to ignore node_modules and build files:
  ```
  node_modules/
  dist/
  .env
  *.log
  ```
- **Explanation:** `.gitignore` tells git to skip files/folders you don't want to upload (like dependencies and build outputs).

## Need More Help?
- Ask for a README.md or more setup help if needed!
- Explore GitHub Docs: https://docs.github.com/en
- **Explanation:** GitHub Docs have detailed guides for beginners and advanced users.
