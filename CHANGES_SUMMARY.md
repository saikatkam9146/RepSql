CHANGES_SUMMARY

This file documents the edits and additions made to the ReportingSchedulerWeb project during our session. It explains what changed, why, and next steps to get the new API integration working.

---

Summary (high level)
- Added typed user models and a `UsersService` that calls a backend API (CRUD endpoints).
- Wired `HttpClientModule` into the standalone bootstrap so services can use HttpClient.
- Updated Users list, Create User, and Edit User components to call the service instead of in-memory stubs.
- Fixed templates and bindings to avoid runtime/template errors and to use Angular forms correctly.
- Added documentation files (`GitHubPushGuide.txt`, `ProjectGuide.txt`) earlier and updated them.

Files created (new)
- `src/app/models/user.model.ts` — Typed TypeScript interfaces for users and related objects (UserItem, UserRecord, Department, UserAccess, TimeZoneOffset). Purpose: strong typing, avoid implicit 'any' errors, and provide a single place to manage user data shape.

- `src/app/services/users.service.ts` — Angular Injectable service (providedIn: 'root') that implements CRUD operations against a users API:
  - `getUsers()` -> GET /api/users
  - `getUser(id)` -> GET /api/users/:id
  - `createUser(payload)` -> POST /api/users
  - `updateUser(id, payload)` -> PUT /api/users/:id
  - `deleteUser(id)` -> DELETE /api/users/:id
  Purpose: centralize HTTP calls and error handling. NOTE: The base URL is currently set to `https://localhost:5001/api/users` — update this to your actual backend URL.

Files modified (existing) and why
- `src/app/app.config.ts`
  - Added `importProvidersFrom(HttpClientModule)` so the standalone app bootstrap provides `HttpClient` to services. Reason: Using standalone components + bootstrapApplication requires providing HttpClient via providers.

- `src/app/components/users/users.component.ts`
  - Replaced in-memory static data with a call to `UsersService.getUsers()` on init.
  - Added `deleteUser()` to call `UsersService.deleteUser()` and update the list on success.
  - Added `loading` and `error` flags for basic UI status.
  Purpose: make the users list load real data from the API and perform deletes.

- `src/app/components/users/users.component.html`
  - Added loading/error display, "Delete" button for each row, and safe (`?.`) bindings for nested objects. Purpose: match the new runtime flow and avoid errors when data is missing.

- `src/app/components/create-user/create-user.component.ts`
  - Replaced static in-memory insert logic with a call to `UsersService.createUser(payload)` and navigation back to `/users` on success.
  - Added `cancel()` method to navigate back.
  Purpose: create users through the API instead of local mock lists.

- `src/app/components/create-user/create-user.component.html`
  - Bound form inputs with `[(ngModel)]` to `newUser` fields and changed the form submit to `(ngSubmit)="saveUser()"`. Purpose: collect form data and submit to service.

- `src/app/components/edit-user/edit-user.component.ts`
  - Reworked component to read `id` from `ActivatedRoute`, call `UsersService.getUser(id)` and populate `userWrapper` (the `UserRecord`).
  - `saveUser()` now calls `UsersService.updateUser(id, userWrapper.User)`.
  - `cancel()` navigates back to `/users`.
  Purpose: perform update via API and load the existing user from backend.

- `src/app/components/edit-user/edit-user.component.html`
  - Rewrote template to use `*ngIf="userWrapper"` and bind inputs to `userWrapper.User` / `userWrapper.Department` etc. This ensures bindings are only active after data loads and fixes template errors.

- `src/app/components/edit-database/edit-database.component.html`
  - Minor fix: changed form submit to call `saveDatabase()` with no arguments to match the component method signature.

- `src/app/components/create-database/*`, `edit-database/*` and other previously touched files
  - I made earlier changes to align create/edit forms and remove duplicate navbars; those changes remain and I did not overwrite them here.

Documentation added/updated
- `GitHubPushGuide.txt` — Added step-by-step GitHub push instructions and explanations for beginners.
- `ProjectGuide.txt` — High-level guide about the project structure and how components and routing were set up.
- `CHANGES_SUMMARY.md` (this file) — A precise changelog for what I changed and why.

How to configure and test the new Users API integration (quick steps)
1. Update `src/app/services/users.service.ts`:
   - Replace `private base = 'https://localhost:5001/api/users';` with your real API base URL.
2. Ensure the backend is running and allows CORS from `http://localhost:4200` (or the port you serve the frontend on).
3. Start the frontend:
   ```powershell
   cd D:\Angular\ReportingSchedulerWeb
   npm install        # if you haven't already
   npx ng serve --open
   ```
   If port 4200 is in use, use `--port 4300` or free the port.
4. Open the Users page:
   - The list should load (or show an empty list if backend returns nothing).
   - Create: click +, fill the form, click Save (navigates back on success).
   - Edit: click Edit on a row, change fields, click Save (navigates back on success).
   - Delete: click Delete and confirm — the row will be removed on success.

Next recommended steps
- Implement the same CRUD wiring for Databases (I can do this next).
- Add an HTTP interceptor for auth token/headers and centralized error handling.
- Add unit tests for services and critical components.
- Replace alert(...) with a nicer toast/notification system.

Notes and caveats
- The service methods currently throw the original HTTP error for create/update/delete so errors reach the caller; you may want to standardize error handling with `catchError` and return user-friendly messages.
- The user's data shape (UserRecord) is based on prior code; adjust the model if your API returns a different JSON structure.

If you want, I can now:
- Implement the Databases CRUD service and wire the database components similarly.
- Add an in-memory fallback so the app can work without a backend while you develop.
- Create a small README or developer notes summarizing the run commands and troubleshooting tips.
